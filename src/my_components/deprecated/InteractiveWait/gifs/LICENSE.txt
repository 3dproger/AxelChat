Websites
Set a link to icons8.com on all pages where you use our content. If you use it on most pages, a link in your footer is fine.

Desktop Apps
macOS and Windows applications should have the link to https://icons8.com in the About dialog.

Mobile Apps
For smartphone apps, please set a link to https://icons8.com in the About dialog or settings.
Also, please credit our work in your App Store or Google Play description (something like "Icons by Icons8" is fine).

Open Source
Established open source projects could get the icons for free. For you, we'll opensource the resources that you need.
By established projects we mean the Wikipedia criteria. If you have a page on Wikipedia and it's not removed for a week, you're qualified.
