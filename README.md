# FAQ
- Is AxelChat considered a viewer? - Depending on the version of AxelChat and depending on the streaming platform, this may or may not be the case. If possible, we try not to allow AxelChat to be considered a viewer
- Does AxelChat work with YouTube premieres? - Yes
- Can I download a YouTube chat for an already past stream using the AxelChat? - No, use something else instead. For example, use the browser extension [Save Live Streaming Chats for YouTubeâ„¢](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-live-streaming-chats/bcclhcedlelimlnmcpfeiabljbpahnef)

# Known Issues
- YouTube: messages that YouTube may find inappropriate are not displayed
- YouTube: works only with open access broadcasts or available via the link. Private broadcasts are not supported
- YouTube: Doesn't work for streams with age and possibly other restrictions
- Telegram: avatars of users who have disabled the display of avatars in the privacy settings are not displayed

# Troubleshooting
### Doesn't connect (General)
- Check the correctness of the specified stream links/channel name
- Check your internet connection
- Check proxy settings if using
- Check your firewall settings

### Doesn't connect (YouTube)
- Check that the broadcast is not over
- Check that the broadcast is publicly available or accessed via a link. Private broadcasts are not supported

### Twitch: Avatars not showing
- Check that the link to the channel is correct
- Check that the OAuth-token is correct. Update the OAuth-token, if necessary, by pressing the corresponding button in the AxelChat
- Check in the settings of your Twitch account if the permission to use the twitch account has not been revoked. Update the OAuth-token, if necessary, by pressing the corresponding button in the AxelChat

### Control panel web page does not open correctly
- Make sure you're logged into your streaming site in your default browser
- Make sure that you have specified a stream in AxelChat that belongs to your streaming platform account in the default browser, and not someone else's stream

# Build AxelChat from source for Windows 7 and newer, x64
### Installing Qt
1. Download [Open Source Qt online installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) or you can also find the offline installers. Use VPN if necessary
1. Run Qt installer and login/sign-up if required
1. While installing select components:
    * Qt / Qt 5.15.x / MinGW x.x.x 64-bit
    * Developer and Designer Tools / Qt Creator x.x.x CDB Debugger Support
    * Developer and Designer Tools / Debugging Tools for Windows
    * Developer and Designer Tools / OpenSSL 1.1.1x Toolkit / OpenSSL 32-bit binaries
    * Developer and Designer Tools / OpenSSL 1.1.1x Toolkit / OpenSSL 64-bit binaries

### Build source for Windows x64
1. Clone repo or download source
1. Create file `src/secrets.h` with contents:
```
#pragma once
#define CRYPTO_KEY_32_BYTES "<think up and insert a 32-character encryption code>"
#define TWITCH_CLIENT_ID "<Paste Twitch client ID here>"
#define TWITCH_SECRET "<Paste Twitch secret here>"
#define TROVO_CLIENT_ID "<Paste Trovo client ID here>"
#define VK_APP_ID "<Paste VK application ID here>"
#define VK_SECURE_KEY "<Paste VK secret here>"
#define WASD_API_TOKEN "<Paste WASD API key here>"

#define DONATIONALERTS_API_KEY "<Paste DonationAlerts API key here>"
```
3. Open file `<AxelChat_project_folder>/src/AxelChat.pro` with Qt Creator
1. In Qt Creator select `Desktop Qt x.x.x MinGW 64-bit` kit
1. Select `Release` building mode
1. Click button `Build Project "AxelChat"`. If successful build, folder `release_win64` will appear in the project folder with AxelChat.exe and other files
1. Unpack files from `<AxelChat_project_folder>/app_files/win64.zip` to `<AxelChat_project_folder>/release_win64`

1. Run `<AxelChat_project_folder>/release_win64/AxelChat.exe` or click `Run` in Qt Creator
1. For subsequent builds, just close `AxelChat.exe` application and click `Run` in Qt Creator

Note: to release an AxelChat for use by other users, I recommend to check if all the required DLLs (\*.so for Linux) are in the folder. [ProcDepMonitor](https://github.com/3dproger/ProcDepMonitor) or [DependencyWalker](https://www.dependencywalker.com/) or analogs can helps you
