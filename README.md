# FAQ
- Is AxelChat considered a viewer? - Depending on the version of AxelChat and depending on the streaming platform, this may or may not be the case. If possible, we try not to allow AxelChat to be considered a viewer
- Does AxelChat work with YouTube premieres? - Yes
- Can I download a YouTube chat for an already past stream using the AxelChat? - No, use something else instead. For example, use the browser extension [Save Live Streaming Chats for YouTubeâ„¢](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-live-streaming-chats/bcclhcedlelimlnmcpfeiabljbpahnef)

- Check your internet connection
- Check proxy settings if using
- Check your firewall settings
