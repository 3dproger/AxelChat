# FAQ
- Is AxelChat considered a viewer? - No, at least for now, for YouTube and Twitch
- Does AxelChat work with YouTube premieres? - Yes
- Can I download a YouTube chat for an already past stream using the AxelChat? - No, use something else instead. For example, use the browser extension [Save Live Streaming Chats for YouTubeâ„¢](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-live-streaming-chats/bcclhcedlelimlnmcpfeiabljbpahnef)

# Known Issues
- YouTube: messages that YouTube may find inappropriate are not displayed
- YouTube: works only with open access broadcasts or available via the link. Private broadcasts are not supported
- YouTube: Doesn't work for streams with age and possibly other restrictions

# Troubleshooting
### Doesn't connect (General)
- Check the correctness of the specified stream links/channel name
- Check your internet connection
- Check proxy settings if using
- Check your firewall settings

### Doesn't connect (YouTube)
- Check that the broadcast is not over
- Check that the broadcast is publicly available or accessed via a link. Private broadcasts are not supported

### Twitch: Avatars not showing
- Check that the link to the channel is correct
- Check that the OAuth-token is correct. Update the OAuth-token, if necessary, by pressing the corresponding button in the AxelChat
- Check in the settings of your Twitch account if the permission to use the twitch account has not been revoked. Update the OAuth-token, if necessary, by pressing the corresponding button in the AxelChat

# Build AxelChat from source for Windows 7 and newer, x64
### Installing Qt
1. Download [Open Source Qt online installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) or you can also find the offline installers
1. Run Qt installer and login/sign-up if required
1. While installing select components:
    * Qt / Qt 5.15.x / MinGW x.x.x 64-bit

    * Developer and Designer Tools / Debugging Tools for Windows
    * Developer and Designer Tools / OpenSSL 1.1.1x Toolkit / OpenSSL 32-bit binaries
    * Developer and Designer Tools / OpenSSL 1.1.1x Toolkit / OpenSSL 64-bit binaries

### Build source
1. Clone repo or download source
1. Create file `src/chat_services/apikeys.h` with contents:
```
#pragma once
#define TWITCH_CLIENT_ID "<Paste Twitch client ID here>"
#define TROVO_CLIENT_ID "<Paste Trovo client ID here>"

Note: to release an AxelChat for use by other users, I recommend to check if all the required DLLs (\*.so for Linux) are in the folder. [ProcDepMonitor](https://github.com/3dproger/ProcDepMonitor) or [DependencyWalker](https://www.dependencywalker.com/) or analogs can helps you
