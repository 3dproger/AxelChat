# FAQ
- Is AxelChat considered a viewer? - No, at least for now, for YouTube and Twitch
- Whether AxelChat sends any user data? - No, except for what is required for authorization on Twitch
- Does AxelChat work with YouTube premieres? - Yes
- Can I download a YouTube chat for an already past stream using the AxelChat? - No, use something else instead. For example, use the browser extension [Save Live Streaming Chats for YouTubeâ„¢](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-live-streaming-chats/bcclhcedlelimlnmcpfeiabljbpahnef)
- Is the source code hidden? - Yes. Until recently, the source code was open, but I hid it due to the reluctance to leak my "company secrets" to potential competitors. I do not exclude that someday I will open the source code again
# Known Issues
